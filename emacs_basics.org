* Why Aquamacs

- Aquamacs Emacs is a emacs with complete Mac user interface, by David
  Reitter.

- Aquamacs's interface is similar to BBEdit or TextMate or in fact any
  modern Mac software. It uses the same keyboard shortcuts Mac users
  are familiar. Also uses tabs, multiple windows, pop up dialogs,
  Apple's help documentation system, etc., and bundles many extra
  packages, in particular LaTeX support.

- If you never used emacs before, or never used a text terminal or
   unix, this is a great choice.

* Why Emacs

1. It controls indentation in perl mode
2. Syntax highlighting for everything
3. Rather than telling you how to do things, it is infinitely expandable
   and customisable (kitchen sink)
4. Uniform commands regardless of task
5. Everything is text and accessible
6. It is available for all computers (vi)
7. Can be run in text terminals
8. Latest emacs version (v.23) has got the basics right
9. I like it

* Other features

- Write in any language or script
- Edit, compile and debug in any programming language
- Remote editing
- Compare two or three files for differences
- File manager
- Image viewer
- News, mail, RSS
- Games  

* History of emacs

- Originally written by Richard Stallman
- GNUemacs
- Xemacs was a fork that is now discontinued
- Many versions for non-Unix environments
- http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/

* Starting and exiting Emacs

- Start emacs
  + Search it: "Aquamacs"
  + Locate it in the Applications folder and pull it into the dock.
  + Start it from command line:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  emacs [filename]
#+END_SRC

  + Run it in the terminal, i.e. No Window, 

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  emacs -nw [filename] 
#+END_SRC

- Exit emacs:

  + Menu: File/Quit
  + Close the window
  + Keyboard command:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  C-x C-c   save-buffers-kill terminal
#+END_SRC

* Special keys

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  C-x C-c   save-buffers-kill-terminal
#+END_SRC

- Keyboard commands are given with upper case modifier
  keys and lower case characters
  + C - the control key
  + M - meta key, which usually is mapped to alt key

- Modifier keys are kept down when character keys are pressed
- Meta key can be replaced by the ESC key. 
  + It is pressed and released before pressing the character key.
- Shift key is implicit if needed to reach the character key

* Typing a command 

- All commands have names
- Most have keyboard short cuts
- Command names are given by starting with M-x and typing the name
  with spaces between words.
- TAB completion can be used at any time

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  M-x save-buffers-kill-terminal <Return>
#+END_SRC

- Typing appears at the bottom of the window echo area
- Command is executed when the Return key is pressed
- All commands are added to the special buffer called \texttt{*Messages*}

* Text movement and editing commands

- CUA mode
  - Make sure that CUA mode is active (Options menu)
    + Options/Save Options (into ~/.emacs file)
  - CUA mode gives you standard keybindings to copy, delete, paste
  - Selection works by S-arrow
  - Emacs default to start selecting is C-Space

- Editing columns of text

  - Select several lines down starting from the first column

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  C-Return  cua-set-rectangle-mark
#+END_SRC

  - type characters or use CUA edit commands to see the effect
  - Finish with C-c 

* Some basic text editing commands

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
   C-t    transpose-chars
   C-k    kill-line

   M-u    upcase-word
   M-l    downcase-word
   M-c    capitalize-word
#+END_SRC

  - bash has all these!

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
   C-u         universal-argument
   C-u 40 #    (try it!)
#+END_SRC



* Opening and saving files

  - Common ones:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
	C-x C-f		Find file
	C-x C-s		Save file
	C-x s		Save some buffers
	C-x C-b		List buffers
	C-x b		Switch buffer
	C-x C-c		Quit Emacs
	C-x 1		Delete all but one window
	C-x u		Undo
#+END_SRC

  - pressing ESC-ESC-ESC can get you of anything

* Finding and replacing

  - Cumulative search

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
    C-s <characters>   isearch-forward
    C-r <characters>   isearch-backward
    C-s C-w            search next word
    C-s C-s            repeat search
#+END_SRC

  - Replace
    - The only common command with no mnemonics

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
   M-%  query-replace
   C-M-% (translated from <escape> C-%)  query-replace-regexp
#+END_SRC

* Advanced editing from emacs

- Shell commands on region

  + Select text and type the command below, followed by 'grep a'

#+BEGIN_SRC shell  
  M-|      shell-command-on-region
  C-u M-|  shell-command-on-region and replace region
#+END_SRC


- Shell command from emacs

#+BEGIN_SRC shell  
M-!             shell-command
#+END_SRC

- Running shell within emacs

#+BEGIN_SRC shell  
M-x shell      run a shell in emacs window
#+END_SRC

* Version control

Emacs detects automatically if the file you are editing is under a
version control system.

  - You need one command to add a file to the version control system
    and commit new changes:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  C-x v v   vc-next-action
#+END_SRC

  - For other commands, look under Tools/Version Control

* Emacs concepts: windows, frames, files, and buffers


  - Menu bar, tool-bar, mode line, echo area
  - file
    + Emacs opens stored files into a buffer
  - buffer
    + Everything is displayd in its own buffer
    + A buffer can need not be stored in a file
    + Any buffer can be saved into a file
  - frame
    + is what emacs calls GUI windows
    + you can open more than one frame

* Working with many windows

  - An emacs frame can have more then one window each displaying a buffer
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
    C-x 3   split-window-horizontally
    C-x 2   split-window-vertically
    C-x 1   delete-other-windows
    C-x o   other-window
#+END_SRC

* modes

** Major modes
  + dired
  + org mode http://orgmode.org/
    - note taking
    - outlining
    - todo lists
    - project planning
    - authoring (export to Latex)
  + latex mode
  + computer language modes

** Minor modes

  + CUA mode: C-x, C-c, C-v, C-z work as expected
  + table mode to create tab-delimited files: part of org mode
  + line numbers:  M-x linum-mode
  + spellchecker: M-x fly-spell-mode
  + code syntax checking: M-x flymake-mode

* perl mode

- The default emacs perl mode is functional but limited
- the cperl mode is more comprehensive

- To change to cperl:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 C-x cperl-mode
#+END_SRC

-  To always use cperl mode, put this into your .emacs file and restart

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 (defalias 'perl-mode 'cperl-mode)
#+END_SRC

* Tutorials

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  C-h t  help-with-tutorial
  C-h r  info-emacs-manual
#+END_SRC
