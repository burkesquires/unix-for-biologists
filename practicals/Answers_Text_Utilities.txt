** 1.
How can you use the cat and grep commands, together with pipes
  to search for pattern in a file?


  cat filename | grep pattern



** 2.
How can you use cut, paste and IO redirection to create a new
  file with only the first and second columns?


One command:

  cut -f 1,3 filename


or broken into smaller steps:


cut -f1 filename > col1
cut -f 3 filename > col3
paste col1 col2




** 3.
File 'data/mimivirus.sw' contains all UniProt entries from these
  giant viruses. How many of these are from TrEMBL and how many from
  Swiss-Prot?

  - Swiss-Prot format: http://web.expasy.org/docs/#DT_line

  - Hint: Use caret to anchor the grep search string to the beginning
    of the line, e.g. "\land ID"


  cat mimivirus.sw | grep "^DT"| grep -c Swiss
  cat mimivirus.sw | grep "^DT"| grep -c Tre
  # in one command:
  cat mimivirus.sw | grep "^DT"| \
    grep integrated | cut -d/ -f2| sort| uniq -c
  #  933 Swiss-Prot.
  #  982 TrEMBL.



** 4.
Extract all primary accession numbers from 'data/mimivirus.sw'
  into a file. (http://web.expasy.org/docs/userman.html#AC_line)
  

  cat mimivirus.sw | grep ^AC | \
    cut -d\; -f1| cut -d\  -f4 > mimi.ac

** 5. 
How many different GO terms have been assigned to mimivirus proteins
  in file 'data/mimivirus.sw'?

  mimivirus.sw | grep 'GO;'| sort -u | wc -l
  # 308



** 6.
How many sequences are there in the file 'data/mimivirus.fa'?
  How many are uncharacterized?
  - Fasta format description: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format

  cat mimivirus.fa | grep -c '>'
  # 1915
  cat mimivirus.fa | grep '>' | \
    grep -ci Uncharacterized 
  # 1145
  cat mimivirus.fa | grep '>' | grep -vi \
    Uncharacterized | grep -vci Putative
  # 167


** 7.
Files 'one.ids' and 'two.ids' in directory data/ are lists of
  mimivirus sequence IDs. How many of the IDs are shared in two files?
  Extract  all IDs that are uniq to file 'two.ids'.

- Hint: Use grep -f


  grep -f one.ids two.ids | wc -l
  # 10
  grep -v -f one.ids two.ids > two_uniq.ids 

** 8.
File 'data/contamination.vulgar' shows exonorate homology search in
  vulgar format (see vulgar.readme). Use command line tools to extract
  target (subject) ids and count them.


  cat contamination.vulgar | \
  cut -d\  -f6 | \
  sort -u | \
  wc -l
  # 2174
